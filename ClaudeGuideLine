The repomix-output.txt file contains my entire codebase. Please review the overall structure from the repomix-output.txt file and convert iOS Swift code with UI screenshot from attached files to my code style and code guidelines:
Coding Guidelines:

-Review Swift code and Screenshot file to create UI with correct style
-All new features should have corresponding navigation
-UserPreferences in Swift code will be replaced with PreferencesRepository
-The TextView size should use sp unit (1sp = 1dip) with this format: "@dimen/dimen_[size]sp" for example: android:textSize="@dimen/dimen12sp"
-View width and height should use dp with this format: "@dimen/dimen[size]dp_h" for example (@dimen/dimen_14dp_h). If the text or background color looks like black, it should use this format: "?android:textColorPrimary"
-The UI should display and match correctly with iOS screenshot and Swift code including: color, text size, and the relationship between View components
-Use MaterialCardview in spite of cardview
-The text size should be calculated in dip units and avoid bigger text sizes as they will not look good
-The adapter will use SingleLayoutAdapter
-Please review and convert all Swift code to avoid missing any conversions
-iOS PickerView will be replaced with WheelView and BottomSheet on Android
-Always review and implement code instead of leaving comments
-Add string resource file
-Always consider optimizing code, creating reusable code, and avoiding unnecessary repetition.
-The API should be defined inside ApiVnMobileservice, implemented inside ApiServiceImp and used with ApiService (Note: only define API if iOS function is related to getting data from network or URL)
-Need convert all swift code in spite of leave comment like that : ... shortened for brevity
-All IOS Swift code need to match and replace with android code
-The code have to support android sdk version from 24
